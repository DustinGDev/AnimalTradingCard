			<p>The lion is one of the big cats in the 
			Felidae family. Highly distinctive, male lions are easily 
			recognized by their manes, and the male's face is one of the 
			most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture. Depictions 
			have existed from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and 
			paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves in France dated to 17,000 
			years ago, through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they 
			once occurred. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures, in paintings, 
			on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been 
			kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire, and have been a key 
			species sought for exhibition in zoos over the world since the late eighteenth 
			century. Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered 
			Asiatic lions.</p>
